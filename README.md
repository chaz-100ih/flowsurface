### Some of the features:

[Download here](https://github.com/chaz-100ih/flowsurface/releases)

- Customizable and savable grid layouts, selectable themes
- Supports most of the spot(USDT) and linear/inverse perp pairs from Binance & Bybit
- Tick size multipliers for price grouping on `FootprintChart` & `HeatmapChart`
- Alongside traditional Time-based charts, `CandlestickChart` & `FootprintChart` supports "ticks"(based on aggregated trade streams) to be used as intervals to create Tick-based charts

##### User receives market data directly from exchanges' public REST APIs & Websockets over TLS

- Orderbook total bid/ask levels: 1000 for Binance Perp/Spot; 500 for Bybit Perps, 200 for Bybit Spot
- Binance perp/spot & Bybit perp pairs streams @100ms; Bybit spot pairs streams @200ms
- As historical data, it can fetch OHLCV, open interest and partially, trades:

#### Historical trades on footprint chart:

Optionally, you can enable trade fetching from settings menu, experimental because of unreliability:

- Binance connector supports downloading historical trades from [data.binance.vision](https://data.binance.vision), fast and easy way to get trades, but they dont support intraday data.
Intraday trades fetched by pagination using Binance's public REST APIs: `/fapi/v1/aggTrades` & `api/v3/aggTrades`, which might be slow because of rate-limits

- Bybit itself doesnt have a similar purpose public REST API

Flowsurface can use those ends with Binance tickers to visualize historical public trades while being independent of a 'middleman' database between exchange and the user

So, when a chart instance signal the exchange connector after a data integrity check, about missing trades in the visible range; it tries via fetching, downloading and/or loading from cache, whichever suitable to get desired historical data
